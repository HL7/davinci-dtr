Some of the implementation expectations related to DTR are not conformance expectations that relate to the specification itself, but rather business practices that will need to be in place within and amongst the organizations that implement the specification.  This section describes considerations that should be taken into account as part of establishing such agreements and practices, whether done on a site-by-site basis, or as part of a network organization.

<!-- ### Business Agreements -->

### Additional Recommendations
* The 'SHOULD' conformance requirement [spc-1](specification.html#spc-1) is likely to become a 'SHALL' in a future release of this specification.
