# 10 - This link is intended to be version-independent
% The link 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-dtr' for "Documentation Templates and Rules (DTR)" is a canonical link and is therefore unsafe with regard to versions
   
# 11 - Not necessary for the examples

# 14 - Flagging conformance verbs that are not used as conformance language in the IG
%FHIR-52804 (Non-Compatible)%
%FHIR-52804 - Change SHOULD to SHALL%
%The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: 'This implementation guide uses specific terminology such as SHALL, SHOULD, MAY to flag statements that have relevance for the evaluation of conformance with the guide. As well, profiles in this implementation guide make use of the mustSupport element. Base expectations for the intepretations of these terms are set in the FHIR core specification and general Da Vinci-wide expectations are defined in HRex.'%
%The html source contains the word 'SHALL' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: 'Each of these IGs recommends a set of metrics that may be collected by each implementation to facilitate the evaluation of adoption, functionality, processes, and improved outcomes. While there is currently no requirement to aggregate these metrics, it is reasonable to believe that, in the future, interested entities (providers, payers, regulators, quality organization, certification agencies, states, etc.) will ask for these metrics to evaluate the ongoing automation of the supported processes and exchanges. While this guide will not require these metrics to be captured in this release, the authors strongly suggest each implementation should do so with the expectation that collection and dissemination of these metrics may become a requirement ('SHALL') in future versions of these IGs.%
%The html source contains the word 'SHOULD' but it is not in a text phrase marked as a conformance clause: 'The 'SHOULD' conformance requirements spec-12 and spec-33 are likely to become a 'SHALL' in a future release of this specification.'%

# 15 - These are R5 resources, so we have to (and do) point to the R5 version
%DA VINCI: The How to Read page (background.html) needs to include a reference to the http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/actordefinition.html because this IG uses the actordefinition resource.%
