# See the following statement from Grahame about the next two issues: https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179252-IG-creation/topic/questionnaire-derivationType.20warning.20question

The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/questionnaire-derivationType is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:Questionnaire.item; this element is [Questionnaire.derivedFrom, QuestionnaireResponse.contained/*Questionnaire/home-o2-sdc-adaptive-questionnaire*/.derivedFrom, canonical])

The derivation type 'null#null' is unknown, which means that no derivation checking has been performed against this questionnaire


# QuestionnaireResponse.questionnaire is a cannonical URL which points to the actual Questionnaire, but in the example the Questionnaire is not published anywhere
The questionnaire 'http://example.com/Questionnaire/referred-questionnaire' could not be resolved, so no validation can be performed against the base questionnaire

# Adaptive questionnaire should be contained in a QuestionnaireResponse, there is an example for the QuestionnnaireResponse for an adaptive questionnaire
The Implementation Guide contains no explicitly linked examples for this profile

# Unable to validate HCPCS code system 
Code System URI 'http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Coding/HCPCSReleaseCodeSets' is unknown so the code cannot be validated

# Example code system in the example
Code System URI 'http://example.org' is unknown so the code cannot be validated

# Examples only
Rule dom-6: 'A resource should have narrative for robust management' Failed (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource) (Best Practice Recommendation)
