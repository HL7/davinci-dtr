WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-dtr/StructureDefinition/dtr-questionnaireresponse').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on QuestionnaireResponse derive from the core US profile.

# This is for an example of a Parameters resource containing a DTR Bundle. It should not have it's own narrative.
Rule dom-6: 'A resource should have narrative for robust management' Failed (defined in http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/DomainResource) (Best Practice Recommendation)

%For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

  
# This link is intended to be version-independent
% The link 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-dtr' for "Documentation Templates and Rules (DTR)" is a canonical link and is therefore unsafe with regard to versions
  
  
# This will occur in the next major release
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/temp: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)
  
  
# Not necessary for the examples
%could usefully have an OID assigned (OIDs are easy to assign - see https://build.fhir.org/ig/FHIR/fhir-tools-ig/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html#ig-parameters-auto-oid-root)
  
  
# An example does exist within the IG as a contained resource in the QuestionnaireResponse for Adaptive
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-dtr/StructureDefinition/dtr-questionnaire-adapt'): The Implementation Guide contains no explicitly linked examples for this profile
